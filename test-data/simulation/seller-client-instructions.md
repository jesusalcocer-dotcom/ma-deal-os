# Client Instructions — Seller Side

**Re:** Sale of DataFlow Analytics to Apex Capital

Team,

Excited to get this deal done. Here's what I need from you:

## Priority: Speed
I want this closed in 45 days if possible. We've been working on this for months and I don't want to give the buyer time to renegotiate. My board is aligned and I don't want them getting cold feet either.

## Key Concerns

### Employee Protection
Our team is everything. I want strong protections for them in the agreement:
- No layoffs for at least 12 months post-closing
- Maintain current compensation and benefits packages
- My VP of Engineering and Head of Product should get change-of-control bonuses — talk to me about the right structure

### My Continued Role
I'm planning to stay on as CEO for the transition period (24 months per the term sheet). I want to make sure my authority is clearly defined during that period. I don't want the PE guys micromanaging my product decisions.

### Contractor Classification
We have about 15 independent contractors. They've been with us for 1-3 years. I'm confident they're properly classified — they use their own equipment, set their own hours, and work for other clients. Don't let the buyer make this a bigger issue than it is.

### IP Matters
All our IP is clean. We developed everything in-house. There's one open-source component (Apache-licensed) in our analytics engine but that's fine for commercial use. Also, we have a provisional patent application for our predictive modeling algorithm — make sure that transfers properly.

### Financial Statements
Our audited financials are solid. The only thing I'll flag is that we did an unusual revenue recognition for a large multi-year contract with Meridian Corp last year. Our auditors approved it but it might look odd. Happy to explain if they ask.

## What I Don't Care About
- I'm fine with standard reps and warranties. Don't fight over every qualifier.
- The non-compete is fine. I'm not going to compete with them.
- Escrow terms seem high but whatever — I'll get the money eventually.

## Documents I Have Ready
- Audited financials (2023-2025)
- Employee census (I'll send over, might need to update a few recent hires)
- Contract summaries for top 20 customers
- Cap table (fully diluted)
- IP assignment agreements for all employees

Let me know what else you need. I'm available anytime.

Best,
Michael
