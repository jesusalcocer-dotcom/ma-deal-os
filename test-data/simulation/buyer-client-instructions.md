# Client Instructions — Buyer Side

**From:** Sarah Blackwell, Partner, Apex Capital Partners
**To:** Outside Counsel
**Re:** Acquisition of DataFlow Analytics, Inc.

---

Counsel,

We're moving forward with the DataFlow acquisition. Here are my priorities and concerns:

## Overall Strategy
This is a platform acquisition for our digital services portfolio. We plan to use DataFlow as the anchor for a buy-and-build strategy in analytics SaaS. We need the deal structured to support add-on acquisitions within 12-18 months.

## Key Concerns

### Due Diligence Priorities
1. **Employee classification** — I have concerns about their independent contractors. 15 contractors with 1-3 year tenures sounds like misclassification. I want a thorough analysis and appropriate indemnification. The special escrow needs to be robust.

2. **Revenue recognition** — I've heard the CEO mention an "unusual" approach with a large customer contract. I want our accountants to review this carefully. If there's a restatement risk, we need to know before signing.

3. **IP cleanliness** — Open source dependencies need full audit. I want to make sure their Apache-licensed component doesn't create any copyleft contamination risk. Also need to verify all employee IP assignment agreements are properly executed.

4. **Customer concentration** — Need to understand how much revenue depends on their top 5 customers and what the contract terms look like (auto-renewal, termination for convenience, etc.)

### Deal Structure Concerns
- I want the working capital mechanism tight. Their WC target should be based on a net working capital calculation excluding cash and debt. Need clear definitions.
- The general escrow at 10% is fine but I want the special escrow for employee classification to be clearly ring-fenced.
- R&W insurance: we've already engaged [broker] to quote. Expect $80-100K premium for $30M coverage. Make sure the retention aligns with the basket.

### Rep & Warranty Priorities
- I want "knowledge" qualified where it matters but not on financial statements, tax, or employee matters.
- Data privacy reps need to be strong — they process customer data and may be subject to CCPA/GDPR depending on customer base.
- Need a specific rep on government contracts (if any) and export controls.
- Material contracts definition: threshold at $100,000 annual value.

### Post-Closing
- Management retention agreements: CEO and CTO each get 2x base salary if terminated without cause within 24 months. Vesting of any rollover equity over 4 years.
- I want board control immediately at closing. The CEO stays operational but strategic decisions go through our board.
- Transition services: we'll need their finance team for 6 months minimum while we integrate back office.

## Speed
I'm comfortable with the 60-day timeline but I will NOT rush diligence. If we need more time to get the DD right, we take it. I'd rather extend to 90 days than miss something material.

## Budget
Keep fees under $500K for the buy-side. I know deals like this run $400-600K but let's stay disciplined.

Please set up the VDR review protocol and get the DD request list out by end of week.

Sarah
