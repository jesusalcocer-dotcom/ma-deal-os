**Target:** CloudBridge Analytics, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Company")

### TRANSACTION STRUCTURE

Reverse Triangular Merger. Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The separate existence of Merger Sub will cease.

### CONSIDERATION

**Aggregate Consideration:** Approximately $310,000,000, consisting of:
- Cash: $232,500,000 (75%)

**Per Share Merger Consideration:** Each share of Company common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than dissenting shares and shares held by Parent, Merger Sub, or the Company) will be converted into the right to receive the applicable pro rata portion of the Aggregate Consideration.

**Treatment of Company Options:** All outstanding Company stock options, whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash equal to the excess of the per-share merger consideration over the exercise price, less applicable withholding taxes. Options with exercise prices above the per-share consideration will be cancelled for no consideration.

**Treatment of Company RSUs:** All outstanding restricted stock units will fully vest and be cancelled in exchange for the per-share merger consideration.
