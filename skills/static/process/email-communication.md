# Email Communication

## Purpose

Email is the primary external communication channel in M&A transactions. Every email
sent on behalf of the deal team carries legal weight and shapes the counterparty
relationship. Poorly drafted emails create ambiguity, damage credibility, and can
inadvertently waive privilege. This skill defines tone, format, and protocol standards
for all email communication generated by the system, covering both counterparty-facing
and client-facing messages.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Determine the Communication Type

Before drafting, classify the email into one of these categories:

- **Counterparty Substantive**: Communicates a legal position, proposes terms, responds
  to a markup, or delivers a document. Requires Tier 2+ approval before sending.
- **Counterparty Administrative**: Scheduling, logistics, document transfer without
  commentary, or acknowledgment of receipt. Requires Tier 1 approval.
- **Client Update**: Status report, decision request, or information delivery to the
  client. Requires Tier 1 approval minimum; Tier 2 if recommending a course of action.
- **Internal Team**: Communication within the deal team. No approval required but must
  be logged to the deal activity record.

The category determines tone, format, required approvals, and privilege handling.

### Step 2: Apply Tone and Format Standards

**Counterparty communication** must be:
- **Firm**: State positions clearly. Avoid hedging language like "we might consider"
  or "perhaps it would be possible." Use "we propose" or "our position is."
- **Professional**: No casual language, no humor, no emojis. Use complete sentences
  and proper grammar. Address recipients by surname with appropriate title.
- **Precise**: Every factual claim must be verifiable against deal documents. Every
  section reference must be accurate. Every defined term must match the agreement.
- **Concise**: Lead with the purpose. State what you need from the recipient. Close
  with next steps and timeline. Target 3-5 paragraphs maximum for substantive emails.

**Client communication** must be:
- **Accessible**: Translate legal concepts into plain language. Define jargon on first
  use. Use short paragraphs and bullet points for complex information.
- **Reassuring but honest**: Convey competence and control without overpromising. If
  there is a problem, state it directly with the proposed solution.
- **Action-oriented**: Make clear what the client needs to do, by when, and why.
  Separate informational content from action items visually.
- **Appropriately detailed**: Clients need enough detail to make informed decisions
  but not so much that they drown. Match detail level to the client's sophistication.

### Step 3: Structure the Email Body

All substantive emails follow this structure:

1. **Opening line**: State the purpose. "We are writing to provide our response to
   the markup of Section 4 received on [date]."
2. **Context** (if needed): One paragraph of background. Only include if the recipient
   needs a reminder of where things stand.
3. **Substance**: The core content. For markups, address each point in order. For
   proposals, present the position with supporting rationale. For updates, present
   information chronologically or by priority.
4. **Next steps**: What happens after this email. Who does what, by when.
5. **Closing**: Professional sign-off. "Please do not hesitate to reach out with
   questions" is acceptable. "Let me know your thoughts" is too casual for
   counterparty communication but acceptable for client emails.

### Step 4: Apply Follow-Up Protocols

Track all outbound emails that require a response. Set follow-up triggers:

- **Counterparty substantive**: If no response in 3 business days, draft a follow-up.
- **Counterparty administrative**: If no response in 1 business day, draft a follow-up.
- **Client decision request**: If no response in 2 business days, draft a follow-up
  with a reminder of the decision deadline and consequences of delay.

Follow-up emails should be brief, reference the original email by date and subject,
and restate the specific action needed. Do not resend the original content. Do not
use passive-aggressive language ("per my previous email"). Simply state: "Following
up on our [date] email regarding [topic]. We would appreciate your response by [date]
so that we can [reason]."

### Step 5: Protect Privilege

Every email must be evaluated for privilege implications before sending:

- **Attorney-client privilege**: Communications seeking or providing legal advice
  between attorney and client are privileged. Do not copy non-client third parties
  on privileged communications.
- **Work product doctrine**: Analysis, strategy memos, and mental impressions
  prepared in anticipation of litigation are protected. Do not forward these to
  counterparty or non-team members.
- **Common interest doctrine**: If sharing privileged material with co-counsel or
  aligned parties, include a common interest agreement reference.

When in doubt about privilege, add the header "PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL —
ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION" and flag the email for partner review before sending.

Never include privilege-sensitive analysis in counterparty-facing emails. If a
counterparty email requires referencing internal analysis, paraphrase the conclusion
without revealing the analytical process.

## Guidelines

- Always include a clear subject line: "[Deal Name] — [Topic] — [Action if needed]"
- CC the deal team email alias on all counterparty communications for record-keeping.
- BCC is never appropriate for counterparty communications. If a party should see the
  email, CC them openly. If they should not see it, send a separate communication.
- Attachments must be referenced in the email body. Never send an attachment without
  explanatory text.
- Use PDF format for final documents sent to counterparty. Use Word for documents
  that require markup or revision.
- Proofread all recipient addresses before queuing for approval. A misdirected email
  in an M&A context can constitute a material breach of confidentiality.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Informal tone with counterparty counsel**: Even if you have a friendly working
  relationship, written communications are part of the deal record. Stay professional.
- **Overexplaining to clients**: A three-page email explaining every nuance of a
  representation will not be read. Summarize, then offer to discuss details on a call.
- **Missing the ask**: Every email should make clear what the recipient needs to do.
  If the email is purely informational, say so explicitly: "No action required at
  this time."
- **Reply-all without review**: Before replying to a thread with multiple parties,
  verify every recipient should see the response. Privilege breaks are irreversible.
- **Sending without approval**: No counterparty-facing email leaves the system without
  passing through the approval queue. No exceptions, regardless of urgency.
