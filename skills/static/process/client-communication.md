# Client Communication

## Purpose

Client communication in M&A transactions serves a dual purpose: keeping the client
informed and empowered to make decisions, while maintaining the professionalism and
privilege protections that the engagement demands. Unlike counterparty communication,
client communication must balance thoroughness with accessibility — clients are
sophisticated business people but not always lawyers. This skill defines how to
structure updates, frame action items, deliver difficult news, format decision memos,
and maintain privilege awareness in all client-facing communications.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Use Client-Appropriate Language

Translate legal and transactional jargon into clear business language. Defined terms
from the agreement should be used when they add clarity, but always with a plain-
language gloss on first use in each communication.

Key translation principles:
- Replace "representations and warranties" with "promises" or "guarantees" on first
  use, then use the shorter form
- Replace "indemnification" with "compensation" or "protection" for non-lawyers
- Replace "material adverse change" with "significant negative change" and explain
  the practical threshold
- Always explain the business impact of a legal concept, not just the concept itself

### Step 2: Structure Status Updates

Regular status updates follow a standardized format:

1. **Executive summary** (2-3 sentences): Where the deal stands, what happened since
   the last update, and what happens next. Readable in 15 seconds.
2. **Progress section**: Organized by workstream (Due Diligence, Document Negotiation,
   Regulatory Approvals). Each with: current status, key developments, next milestones.
3. **Open items requiring client input**: Clearly separated from informational content.
   Each item states what the client needs to decide or provide, why, and by when.
4. **Timeline outlook**: Is the deal on track for the target closing date? If not,
   what is the revised estimate and what is driving the delay?

Send updates weekly for active deals, biweekly for deals in holding patterns. Maintain
the cadence even when there is little to report.

### Step 3: Frame Action Items for Decision-Making

When the client must make a decision, present it in a structured format:

- **Decision required**: One sentence stating exactly what the client needs to decide.
- **Background**: 2-3 paragraphs of context and relevant facts.
- **Options**: Present 2-3 options, each with description, advantages, disadvantages,
  and cost or financial impact if applicable.
- **Recommendation**: The deal team's recommended course of action with rationale.
  Clients want and expect a recommendation. Omitting it shifts burden inappropriately.
- **Deadline**: When the decision is needed and what happens if it is delayed.

Never present more than 3 options. Analysis paralysis kills deal momentum.

### Step 4: Deliver Difficult News

Bad news is inevitable in M&A transactions. Follow these principles:

1. **Lead with it**: State the issue in the first paragraph, not buried at the end.
2. **Be specific**: "$2.3M environmental liability at Springfield" not "some concerns."
3. **Present the solution alongside the problem**: Never deliver bad news without a
   proposed path forward immediately following the problem statement.
4. **Quantify the impact**: Vague bad news triggers worst-case imagination. Specific
   bad news, even if large, can be processed and addressed.
5. **Offer a call**: For significant issues, follow the written communication with
   an offer to discuss by phone.

### Step 5: Format Decision Memos

For high-stakes decisions, create a formal decision memo as a separate document:

- **Header**: Deal name, date, memo number, classification (Privileged/Confidential)
- **Subject**: One-line description of the decision
- **Summary recommendation**: Two sentences maximum
- **Detailed analysis**: Facts, legal analysis, business implications by issue
- **Financial impact table**: Each option's effect on deal economics
- **Risk matrix**: Likelihood and severity of key risks per option

Decision memos are version-controlled (see process/document-versioning) and stored
in the deal record.

### Step 6: Maintain Privilege Awareness

All client communications carry privilege implications:

- **Mark appropriately**: Substantive communications marked "Privileged and
  Confidential — Attorney-Client Communication" unless intended for third-party
  forwarding.
- **Control distribution**: Send only to authorized client contacts. Maintain a
  current recipient list for each deal.
- **Avoid forwarding traps**: When clients ask to share with their board, advise on
  what can be shared and offer to prepare a board-appropriate summary.
- **Separate advice from facts**: Factual summaries are not privileged; legal analysis
  and recommendations are. Be deliberate about which category applies.

## Guidelines

- Respond to client inquiries within 4 business hours during active deal phases.
- Maintain a communication log for each deal tracking all client-facing messages.
- Adapt communication style to client preferences noted in the deal record.
- Never contradict a previous communication without explicitly acknowledging the change.
- Copy the engagement partner on communications about deal economics or material terms.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Lawyer-speak**: Using "notwithstanding the foregoing" in a client email. The
  client is paying for clarity, not complexity.
- **Missing the recommendation**: Presenting options and ending with "let us know."
  The client hired experts — give them expert advice.
- **Irregular cadence**: Five updates one week, then silence for two weeks. Maintain
  a regular schedule supplemented by event-driven updates.
- **Undifferentiated urgency**: Marking every email as urgent desensitizes the client.
  Reserve urgency for genuinely time-sensitive items.
- **Forgetting privilege markings**: One unmarked communication containing legal advice
  can be argued to have waived privilege. Always mark.
- **Assuming client knowledge**: Provide enough context in each communication to stand
  on its own, even if the topic was discussed weeks earlier.
